I am a Data Scientist with 3+ years of industry experience, an Eiffel Excellence Scholarship recipient, and an MSc student in Data Science at Université de Lille. I specialize in building robust end-to-end data systems—from cloud data architecture (BigQuery, GCP) to API design (Flask, Cloud Functions) and machine learning (Vertex AI).

Previously, I led the migration of analytics infrastructure to BigQuery, developed machine learning models (forecasting, ROI/MMM), automated end-to-end pipelines and slide & excel reporting using Python, and designed APIs for campaign management platforms. I’ve contributed directly to major wins like Samsung and Unilever pitches through media ROI insights and predictive analytics.

I’m passionate about solving real business problems with data—whether that’s via cloud architecture, AI, or data storytelling. I’m currently open to internships and full-time opportunities in Lille or hybrid setups across France starting late 2025.

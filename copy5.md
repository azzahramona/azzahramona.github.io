**Objective:** Automated KPI Monitoring with Gemini GCP and Power BI

Built an automated pipeline integrating Gemini (Google Cloud) APIs with Power BI to monitor weekly business metrics.
The system:
-	Fetched data via Gemini API
-	Processed it using Python to compare this week's vs last week's metrics
-	Automatically color-coded metrics (Red: Drop, Yellow: Slight Change, Green: Improvement)
-	Pushed updated metrics into Power BI, enabling non-technical users to see KPI health at a glance
‚öô Technologies Used: GCP Gemini API, Python (pandas), Power BI, Power BI Gateway, JSON/REST APIs
